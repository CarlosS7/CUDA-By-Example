CUDA-By-Example
===============

Working through "CUDA By Example" chapters and sample code.  Serves as reference for the future and proof that I've been working on something.  I'm currently working with Windows and Microsoft Visual C/C++, but I may investigate Linux at some point (if I put together a Linux box with CUDA support).

## Requirements
- Visual Studio 2010
- CUDA SDK 5.5
- Windows (naturally)
